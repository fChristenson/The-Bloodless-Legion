# Gray Ministry

## Description

From the outside this house looks lavish. It has been built with fir wood and has walnut wood decorations. Small, rectangular windows add to the overall style of the house and have been added to the house in a fairly asymmetrical pattern.

The house is equipped with a small kitchen and two modern bathrooms, it also has a spacious living room, three bedrooms, a roomy dining area, an office and a modest garage.

The building is shaped like an L. The extension extends into wooden sunscreens structures reaching until the end of that side of the house.
The second floor is the same size as the first, which has been built exactly on top of the floor below it. This floor has a slightly different style than the floor below.

The roof is high and pyramid shaped and is covered with grey wood shingles. One small chimney sits at the side of the house. A few round, small windows let in enough light to the rooms below the roof.
The house itself is surrounded by a gorgeous garden, including various trees, bushes, flowers and a large pond.
